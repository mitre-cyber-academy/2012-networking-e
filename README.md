This is a low level networking challenge. 


There are two servers running that emulate the conversation between Dr. Lanning's hologram and Detective Spooner from iRobot. 
The participants need to send the questions to the server that Spooner asked the hologram. 

The description tells them that the program listens on the port number that is the current year. If they try 2012, it will connect but even if the input is
flawless, it will not give the answer. They need to realize that the current year is actually the year the story takes place, ie 2035. If they connect on this 
port and give the correct input, the flag will be returned.
