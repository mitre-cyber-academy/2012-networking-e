name: "Dr. Lanning's Last Words"
description: |
  Detective Spooner, Dr. Lanning was found outside of his office after a rapid deceleration caused by the pavement outside. We do not believe this was a suicide, unfortunately he is in no state to tell us and all of the security cameras in his office seem to be broken. Luckily he left us a service running at $server that is listening on the port of the current year. We tried talking to it but our guys are at a loss.
